# 3D Unet Framework

This is a Tensorflow 2 based implementation of a generic 3D-Unet.

This repo allows the creation of 3D-Unet of any structure, letting you to choose the depth of the network, number of filters on each level, kernel size on each level, the pooling method, inclusion of dropout after pooling and concatenation, batch normalization after convolutions or not, padding method and the activation function after convolutions.
